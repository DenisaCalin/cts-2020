To develop an online game (with superheroes) implement a software solution that:

1. Game characters actions are affected by their state
- the gameplay is different
- the action effects are different

2. The game has an internal chat
- we want to filter bad comments/messages
- messages intended for a specific player will be private
- broadcast messages shown to everybody

3. The players need to be able to save their character status during gameplay
- they can save their character
- they can restore the game to a previous state

4. The game client needs to do background tasks without interfering with the player gameplay
- backup client data
- get forum updates
- update 3d models
