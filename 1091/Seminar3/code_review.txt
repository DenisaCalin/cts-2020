Code review
1. Change the package structure
	- the main package name: clase -> ro.ase.cts.g1091.seminar3.clase
	- create a package structure
2. Change the name of the Program.class -> TestApp.class
3. Files
	- use a standard for text files contet ->JSON
	- use the same format rules for all files
3. Code
	- constructors with too many arguments
	- the default ctor should private
	- try to fit the content of the functions in one screen (reduce the width)
	- Anagajt: finantare() -> the function just returns a constant value -  you don't need a function for that
	- choose proper names : finantare ?????
	- don't link the functions implementation to a specific GUI (here you linked it to a Console) - don't print strings, return them
	
4. Aplicant
	- the "punctaj" means ? maybe punctajProiect is more clear....
	- the "nr_proiecte" should respect the Java mixed Camel Case: nrProiecte
	- you don't need nr_proiecte; it's redundant data
	- "denumireProiect" it should be "denumireProiecte"; use the plural
	- don't use hrad coded values (see statut)
	
5. Utils
	- too dependent on other classes
	-
