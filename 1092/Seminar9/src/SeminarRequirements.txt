In order to create an online game (with superheroes), you need to create a software solution that will provide

1. Efficient management of the connection to the Database / logger
- the different modules must use or link a unique connection to the database
- programmers implementing those modules cannot build multiple objects associated with the database connection
- the client must use a unique object to take care of the connection to the database

2. Create different character types in the game
- currently there are 3 types of characters POSITIVE, NEGATIVE and OTHER_TYPES
- there is a risk that in the future new types will appear or the existing ones will change

3. Instantiation of the superhero associated with the player
- there are many attributes to allow its customization
- number, is Positive, points Life, weapon Left Hand, weapon Right Hand, super Power, is Wounded Critical, super Super Power, etc.
- an efficient solution must be found that allows the creation of the superhero without giving values for all the attributes but 
also without allowing the programmers to omit some of them
